# Hi, I’m Chandra Sekhar 👋  

Java Backend Developer focused on building **clean, scalable, and maintainable server-side systems** using **Java, Spring, and Spring Boot**.

I specialize in backend engineering fundamentals — designing RESTful APIs, applying layered architectures, working with relational databases, and writing code that is readable, testable, and production-oriented. My approach prioritizes correctness, clarity, and long-term maintainability over shortcuts.

## 🧠 Professional Summary

I am a Java Backend Developer with hands-on experience in building backend applications using the Spring ecosystem. My core strengths lie in **Spring Boot application development**, **REST API design**, **database interaction using JPA/Hibernate**, and **secure authentication using JWT-based Spring Security**.

I have a strong grasp of **object-oriented design principles**, **SOLID principles**, and standard backend engineering practices such as proper exception handling, validation, logging, and clean layering (Controller → Service → Repository).

Previously associated with **Wipro**, where I was exposed to enterprise-grade environments and development workflows. I am currently focused on deepening my practical expertise through **hands-on backend projects**, strengthening system design fundamentals, and preparing for **backend engineering roles** where I can contribute to real-world, production systems.
