# 💫 About Me:
I am a Java Backend Developer with close to 3 years of experience, specializing in building scalable, secure, and production-grade backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies. My core expertise lies in designing clean layered architectures, developing RESTful APIs, implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, and ensuring code quality through best practices.<br><br>I have hands-on experience with Spring Core, Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT, role-based access control), Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, SQL, and REST API design. I follow strong software engineering principles such as SOLID, clean code, and separation of concerns, and I am comfortable working with real-world backend concepts like exception handling, validation, pagination, logging, and API documentation.<br><br>I am highly process-driven, detail-oriented, and focused on building backend systems that are maintainable, testable, and ready for production. Currently, I am strengthening my expertise across microservices, messaging systems, performance optimization, and cloud-readiness to operate effectively at a mid-level backend engineer (SDE-2) capacity.
